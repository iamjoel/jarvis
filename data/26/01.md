### Cowork Released
> A simpler way for anyone—not just developers—to work with Claude in the very same way. 

It has [**same foundations**](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk) of Claude Code: file system access, planning and sub agent delegation.


Cowork handle task in **Agent loop**: **gather context** -> **take action** -> **verify work** -> **repeat**.

[Detail](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview).

After cowork released, there're some similar open source projects released:
* [Open Claude Cowork](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/open-claude-cowork)
* [openwork](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openwork) by Langchain.
* [OpenWork](https://openwork.software/) Built on OpenCode

## 21: AI replaces Software Engineers in less than 1 years
> [AI will take over almost all the work of software engineers (SWEs) end - to - end in just 6 - 12 months!](https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3648851352018565)
> Dario Amodei (CEO of Anthropic)

End - to - end: covers the entire lifecycle of a software product: requirements, design, front - end, back - end, deployment, testing, etc...

At the Davos Forum, two AI giants made a rare joint appearance, initiating a significant dialogue about the future of AGI. Dario Amodei made an astonishing prediction: AI could completely replace software engineers in as little as 6 months! Also, half of junior white-collar jobs will disappear within the next 1 - 5 years.

His confidence comes from a "cycle" that is closing at an accelerating pace. One envisioned mechanism is -
**AI writing its own code → AI conducting its own research → a completely self - iterative closed - loop.**

Once this positive feedback loop runs smoothly, the R & D speed will take off directly and sprint exponentially.

Good News: If you’re a coder maybe. If you’re an engineer, your job is to solve problems not to code.
