# [iFlow](https://github.com/iflow-ai/iflow-cli)

## Solved problem
- Turns your terminal into an AI companion that digests repository context, executes coding or research tasks, and automates everything from file operations to multi-step workflows so teams can stay focused on planning rather than repetitive CLI fiddling. citeturn0search0
- Archives project knowledge inside `IFLOW.md`, giving every workspace a natural-language memory that guides the assistant and keeps follow-up sessions consistent. citeturn0search1

## Features
- Free access to the iFlow open platform models such as Kimi K2, Qwen3 Coder, and DeepSeek v3 lets teams run advanced AI reasoning without per-query costs. citeturn0search0
- Flexible integration keeps bash, zsh, and fish users in their preferred shells while natural-language input replaces arcane flags, enabling autop-run, plan, and resume modes with conversation recovery and context compression. citeturn0search0
- The built-in Open Market installs SubAgents and MCP tools with a click, turning the CLI into a customizable agent team while Task Tool and auto-compress protect long conversations. citeturn0search0
- Multimodal prompts (Ctrl+V images) plus official VS Code and JetBrains plugins surface the assistant inside IDEs while the client silently checks for updates, reducing manual upgrades. citeturn0search0turn0search3

## Different voices
- Loves: Teams cite the natural-language interface plus one-click Open Market/SubAgents for turning iFlow into a collaborative AI squad that can jump from planning to automation without leaving the terminal. citeturn0search0
- Wishes: Developers are still chasing a centralized slash-command reference, as the README simply points to an external list when detailing commands like `/init`, `/agent`, and `/mcp`. citeturn0search0

## Roadmap
- Continued roadmap highlights include broadening the MCP/SubAgent catalog, enhancing GitHub Actions integration for workflow automation, and enabling every user to switch between iFlow’s free models and any OpenAI-compatible API via `~/.iflow/settings.json`. citeturn0search0turn0search4

## Compare with other tools
| Tool | Core functions | Key differentiators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iFlow CLI | Terminal-native AI assistant with natural-language input, Open Market/SubAgent tooling, context compression, and plan-first/execute modes.  | Free AI models, conversation recovery, and MCP/SubAgent automation distinguish iFlow CLI from alternatives that limit workflow or plugin depth.  |
| Claude Code | Anthropic’s CLI companion that leans on structured planning and conversational memory inside the Anthropic safety stack.  | Emphasizes safety and reasoning but lacks iFlow’s Open Market/SubAgent ecosystem for custom workflow orchestration.  |
| Gemini CLI | Google’s CLI experience with Gemini models, primarily targeting general coding assistance with shared conversation history.  | Focuses on model output quality rather than extensible marketplaces, so multi-agent workflow automation needs extra orchestration.  |

## How to use
### Install
- Supported OSes are macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, and Windows 10+ (via WSL or Git for Windows) with at least 4 GB RAM, Node.js 22+, and network connectivity for authentication/AI processing; install with the one-liner `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://cloud.iflow.cn/iflow-cli/install.sh)"` or `npm i -g @iflow-ai/iflow-cli`. citeturn0search0
- Windows-only guidance includes downloading Node.js from nodejs.org, restarting CMD/PowerShell, and installing the package globally before launching `iflow`. citeturn0search0

### Config
- Authentication supports iFlow’s native login or any OpenAI-compatible API key; edit `~/.iflow/settings.json` to point to your preferred base URL, model, and API key, then run `iflow` to complete the handshake. citeturn0search0
- Project memory lives in `IFLOW.md` files generated by `/init`, documenting the workspace, coding standards, and workflow constraints so agents stay aligned across sessions. citeturn0search1

### Run
- Launch `iflow` in the root of the repo, use `/init` to seed IFLOW.md, then describe tasks in plain English or use slash commands (e.g., `/agent`, `/mcp`, `/chat`, `/resume`) to plan-first, execute, or resume workflows; conversation history auto-saves for later rollbacks. citeturn0search0
- Extend the CLI into GitHub Actions, IDE plugins, or shell scripts, letting automation run wherever your pipeline lives while the Task Tool compresses context once it reaches 70% of a model’s window. citeturn0search4
