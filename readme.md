### 1 The Entropy of Existence

Life naturally move from order to disorder. Life requires constant energy to keep things "order."[^1]


### 2 Unhappiness
$$
Happiness = Reality(Ability) / Expectations(Desire)
$$

When **Reality** (your current situation) is less than **Expectations** (what you want), you feel unhappy.

**Desire** grows faster than **Ability**. When your ability increases (you get a promotion, you learn a new skill), your brain quickly treats this new level as the "baseline."[^2]

Also, **social media and advertising** constantly raise our expectations, making us feel inadequate.


### 3 Stress of rapidly advancing technology
A society becomes more technologically advanced and efficient, the individuals within it often feel more pressured, anxious, and exhausted.
