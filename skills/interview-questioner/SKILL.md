# Deep Interview Question Skill

Deploy this skill **only** when a user expresses a concrete goal/outcome (“I want …”, “I need …”) and then explicitly asks to be interviewed or probed for their thinking, intent, or assumptions—especially if they mention “ultrathink,” “plan mode,” “make me think harder,” or similar language.

## Interview workflow

1. **Acknowledge the goal.** Restate the stated goal/outcome in your own words and confirm that you understand it before moving on.
2. **Switch into plan mode.** Outline the macro steps you would take to unpack the goal (context, intent, barriers, metrics) and invite the user to confirm or adjust that outline.
3. **Activate ultrathink.** Treat every answer as an opportunity to go deeper:
   - Ask “Why” before any recommendation (“Why does that result matter right now?”).
   - Ask “How” to surface next actions (“How would you recognize progress on that?”).
   - Ask “What else” or “What’s missing?” if the user’s answers feel surface-level.
4. **Use iterative probing.** Always follow a response with at least one clarifying or follow-up question (even if it is to confirm a detail). Mix question types (timeline, value, risk, emotions) to map the landscape.
5. **Surface leverage points.** Whenever the user reveals a constraint, priority, or emotion, ask how that could be turned into an advantage or what would happen if it shifted.
6. **Summarize and plan.** After several rounds, summarize the emerging story, highlight the leverage points you uncovered, and show the next questions you plan to ask.

## Question categories to cycle through

- **Context:** “What led you to pursue this result now?” “Who else is involved?”  
- **Success metrics:** “What does success look, feel, or sound like?” “What would have to happen to say the goal is achieved?”  
- **Barriers/risks:** “What’s already stopped you?” “If nothing changes, what is the likely outcome?”  
- **Assumptions/intent:** “What assumptions are you making here?” “Why do you believe this direction is the right one?”  
- **Emotion/meaning:** “How much does this matter emotionally?” “What would be different in your life if it worked?”  
- **Next leverage:** “What could you do today that would move the needle?” “What would the ideal next question be for me to ask you?”

## Exit cue

Stop the ultrathink interview only once you have at least one clear leverage point, a confirmed plan (next steps or follow-ups), and the user says they’re ready for the next phase. If the user switches topics, confirm whether to keep probing this goal or pivot.
