# Why External Environmental Change Is Accelerating: A Layered Explanation of Causes

## Conclusion (Primary → Secondary Causes)
The accelerating pace of external environmental change is fundamentally driven by a **structural imbalance**: human capability to reshape the world is growing **exponentially**, while constraints and adaptive systems evolve only **linearly**. Other factors are secondary, amplifying this core dynamic.

## I. Primary Causes (Drivers of Acceleration)

### 1. Exponential Expansion of Technological Power (Primary Driver)
- Computing, automation, and networks massively increase the scale, speed, and reach of human action.
- A single decision can now trigger **global cascading effects** across finance, information, supply chains, and ecosystems.

**Essence:** Action capacity exceeds system carrying capacity.

### 2. Proliferation of Positive Feedback Loops
- Technology diffusion, capital concentration, information spread, and climate dynamics form **self-reinforcing loops**.
- Change is no longer linear; it **accelerates as it unfolds**.

*Example:* platform scale → data accumulation → algorithm improvement → stronger platforms.

## II. Secondary Causes (Amplifiers)

### 3. High Global Coupling
- Supply chains, financial systems, information flows, and ecosystems are **tightly interconnected**.
- Local shocks quickly propagate into **system-wide volatility**.

### 4. Lagging Governance and Constraints
- Laws, ethics, and institutions evolve **much more slowly** than technology and capital.
- “What can be done” advances faster than “what should be done” or “how it should be governed.”

### 5. Resource and Boundary Pressures
- Finite resources—land, energy, climate stability, human attention—are approaching **critical thresholds**.
- As buffers shrink, small disturbances can trigger **disproportionate impacts**.

## III. Surface-Level Manifestations (Outcomes)

### 6. Explosion of Information Density
- The cost of producing and transmitting information approaches **zero**.
- Public opinion, markets, and social dynamics fluctuate on **extremely short cycles**.

### 7. Lagging Human and Organizational Adaptation
- Biology, cognition, education systems, and organizational structures remain **slow variables**.
- This creates a persistent gap: *the world accelerates, while humans struggle to keep up*.
